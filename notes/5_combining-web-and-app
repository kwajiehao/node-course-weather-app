Query strings
    - from the url, we get the query strings
    - server will parse the query string information and make a request, then return a 
    result
    - general structure
        - ... ?< key >=< value >& ...
    - get the query string FROM express route handler on REQUEST object
        - req.query is an object with attributes corresponding to the queries
        - we need conditional logic to ensure that proper query strings are used
            - if (!req.query.search) {
                return res.send({
                    error: 'You must provide a search term!'
                });
            }

Getting data into client side javascript
    - making a http request: FETCH
        - fetch is a browser-based api, so we can use it in all browsers
        - kicks off an async process
