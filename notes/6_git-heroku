NOTE: avoid global modules so that when other people run your code, it can work and not 
fail because of software issues
    - installing as a devDependency: --save-dev
    - devDependencies are dependencies you only need for development, not for running the app

Git
    - 'git init' to initialize repo
    - remember to create a .gitignore file to store files you don't want to track, such
    as node_modules
    - new feature workflow

Deploying to heroku
    - add ssh keys

    - Changes to make
        - 1. provide instructions to heroku    
            - we need to tell heroku to run app.js
            - go to scripts in package.json and modify it
                - add `"start": "node src/app.js"`
                - we can also use the script in npm, using npm run start
        - 2. change the port to listen on to the one provided by heroku
            - this is provided via an environmental variable process.env.PORT
        - 3. make the weather request to correct location
            - modify fetch request url
    - deploy to heroku 
        - git remote shows you that remote is created for you on heroku
        - to deploy, type:
            - git push heroku master
            - rebuild and deploy
