Template engines
    - allow you to render dynamic documents
    - we will use a package called Handlebars
        - we use hbs, which makes it easy to integrate with express
    - allows us to re-use header and footer information across pages instead of
    manually copying and pasting html

Handlebars
    - just like html, but with a few features to add dynamic elements
    - to inject data into a hbs file, use double curly braces {{}}
    - to change the view folder location, use app.set()

Partials with Handlebars    
    - create a small template as part of a bigger webpage to use across a webpage
        - headers, footers
    - to add a partial, use {{>}}
    - in the partial file itself, you can include {{}} to include properties transmitted
    from res.render
        - MAKE SURE THAT ALL THESE PROPERTIES ARE SPECIFIED IN res.render
